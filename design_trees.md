Only one biome has one tree types in them:
* Biome_BorealForest - Black Spruce

Tundras have limited tree growth, but can have the following species:
* Black Spruce
* Siberian Larch
* Dwarf birch - with adaptation
* Arctic Willow - with adaptation, only in low-arctic tundra

* Alder - 10 feet
* Heath/Heathers - only two inches tall, in low arctic tundra, or dwarf heaths in mid-arctic tundra. None in the high-arctic tundra
* Spruce and Fir in milder parts of tundra
