# About Biomebound

Biomebound is a text-based colony management simulation game where you guide a small group of colonists in establishing and growing a sustainable settlement in a vast procedurally-generated world. The game focuses on thoughtful resource management, environmental adaptation, and inter-colony trade.

## Core Features

* Rich Environmental Simulation: Each colony exists on a detailed 10 square kilometer tile with its own unique biome, climate, terrain, and natural resources. The environment affects everything from resource availability to colonist well-being.

* Realistic Time System: The game runs in real-time with a 4:1 time compression - every real-world day equals four in-game days. Colonists work during daylight hours and rest at night, with their schedules affected by seasonal daylight changes based on latitude.

* Complex Resource Management: Manage renewable and non-renewable resources including over 70 types of wood from different tree species; mineral deposits like coal, iron, and precious metals; water sources including rivers, lakes, and springs; food sources such as berries, crops, and foraged items

* Dynamic Colony Development: Your colonists have individual stats, skills, and needs. Health and stress levels affect productivity; sleep and nutrition requirements must be balanced; work assignments determine colony efficiency; population grows naturally, and through immigration, based on colony conditions

* Environmental Challenges: Your colony must manage the environment it is in, including seasonal temperature variations, weather impacts on productivity, terrain effects on resource accessibility, and biome-specific challenges and opportunities

## Multiplayer World

Biomebound takes place in a persistent online world where colonies can:
* Establish trade routes with other player colonies
* Specialize in unique research paths
* Share resources and knowledge
* Adapt to neighboring colony dynamics

## Environmental Variety

Your colony might be located in any of several distinct environments:
* Temperate forests rich in timber
* Tropical regions with year-round growing seasons
* Mountain valleys with mineral wealth
* Coastal areas perfect for trade
* Arctic regions requiring careful resource management
* Desert zones demanding water conservation

Each location presents unique challenges and opportunities that shape your colony's development path.

## World Features

Diverse Terrain Types:
* Mountains and valleys
* Plains and hills
* Coastal regions
* Lakes and rivers

## Getting Started

New colonies begin with 6 colonists and must quickly establish:
* Basic resource gathering
* Food and water security
* Initial shelter
* Essential workplaces

Success requires understanding your environment and making strategic decisions about resource allocation and development priorities.

## Time Investment

The game is designed for both casual and dedicated players:
* Major activities operate on day-long cycles
