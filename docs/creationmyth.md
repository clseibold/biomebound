# The Shaping of the World

As told by the Keepers of Tales, passed down through generations of settlers

In the time before time, when the world was young and unshaped, the great forces of Earth and Sky waged an endless dance. The Sky, ever-changing and restless, painted the world with winds and rains, while the Earth, patient and eternal, sculpted valleys and raised mountains in response to Sky's touch.

From their dance emerged the First Forest, where the most ancient of trees took root. The Bristlecone Pines, wise and twisted, still whisper tales of those earliest days. They tell of how the Earth lifted the mountains to taste the Sky's breath, and how the Sky wept with joy, filling the valleys with lakes and streams.

But the world was not yet complete. The Sky, in its endless motion, breathed life into different corners of the Earth, creating the great biomes. Where its breath was warm and gentle, tropical rainforests burst forth, their Mahogany trees reaching upward like children stretching toward a parent. Where its breath was cool and stern, the Boreal forests took hold, their Black Spruce standing like steadfast guardians against the cold.

The Earth, not to be outdone, pushed forth its bones of granite and coal, gifts for those who would come later. In some places, it lifted its surface into plateaus, in others, it carved deep valleys. Each movement was deliberate, each formation a verse in the ancient song of creation.

The dance continued, and with each passing age, new patterns emerged. The Sky painted seasons across the land - warm summers that coaxed life from soil, winters that tested the resolve of every living thing. The Earth responded by creating sheltered valleys, where springs bubbled forth with sweet water, and hills that could shield against harsh winds.

But the Sky, ever-changeable, taught the greatest lesson of all. No pattern would last forever, no season would remain unchanged. The Earth learned to embrace this change, allowing its forests to shift and transform, its waters to find new paths, its very nature to adapt and evolve.

When the first settlers arrived, they found a world shaped by this eternal dance. Some prospered by learning its rhythms, while others, like Haven's Rest, forgot that change was written into the very fabric of creation. For the dance of Earth and Sky continues still, moving to music that spans ages, reminding all who would build here that adaptation is not merely a skill, but a sacred trust.

And so we who settle these lands must remember: we do not own the Earth, nor can we command the Sky. We are but the latest partners in their ancient dance, and our survival depends on learning its steps, anticipating its turns, and moving in harmony with its endless variations.

Let those who would prosper here heed well these words, for in them lies the wisdom of ages.
