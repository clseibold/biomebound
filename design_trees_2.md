## Tree Species Attributes

This section describes the unique traits, fruiting, wood strength/durability, trunk size, and wood uses of each tree species.

### 1. Mahogany (*Swietenia* spp.)

* **Unique:** Tall tropical hardwood with straight, buttressed trunk and open crown. Bark is gray and crackled.
* **Fruit:** Woody pod capsules (\~15–20 cm long) containing winged seeds; not edible.
* **Wood strength/durability:** Moderately heavy hard maple-colored wood. Janka hardness \~900 lbf. Rot resistance is high – **heartwood** is moderately to very durable.
* **Size:** 40–60 m tall, trunk up to \~1.2 m dia.
* **Uses:** Highly prized for fine furniture, cabinetry, musical instruments, veneer, boatbuilding and carving.

### 2. Kapok Tree (*Ceiba pentandra*)

* **Unique:** Very large tropical tree (often 50–60 m) with thick, straight trunk and huge buttresses. Bark often spiny in youth. Populations produce fluffy seed pods containing *kapok* fibers.
* **Fruit:** 10–15 cm pods filled with silky white fiber (kapok) and seeds; fibers used for stuffing. Pods are not eaten.
* **Wood:** Very light, soft, pale wood. Janka hardness \~280 lbf (127 kgf) – one of the softest commercial woods. Heartwood is non-durable (readily decays); only brown-rot fungi can attack it easily.
* **Size:** Up to \~60 m tall, trunk up to \~1.8 m dia.
* **Uses:** Wood is of low strength; used for plywood cores, lightweight furniture, crates, papier-mâché, floats, model planes, firewood or pulp. (The fiber and seed oil are commercially important.)

### 3. Brazil Nut Tree (*Bertholletia excelsa*)

* **Unique:** Giant Amazon emergent (up to \~50 m) with straight bole. Produces large heavy fruits with edible nuts. Long-lived and gregarious in rainforest.
* **Fruit:** Large woody capsules (\~10–15 cm) weighing up to \~2 kg, containing 8–24 edible Brazil nuts (seeds). Fruits fall; seeds are eaten raw or roasted.
* **Wood strength/durability:** Wood is heavy, hard and very durable (rich in oils). Durability to decay is high, comparable to teak; used historically in boatbuilding.
* **Size:** 30–50 m tall, straight trunk often 1–2 m dia【19†L251-254】.
* **Uses:** Strong quality timber used for flooring, heavy construction, railway sleepers, and boatbuilding. Wood is also used for furniture and cabinetry where available. (Trees are primarily harvested for nuts rather than wood.)

### 4. Rubber Tree (*Hevea brasiliensis*)

* **Unique:** Tropical evergreen, tapped for latex (natural rubber). Deciduous in dry season. Compound leaves and white flowers. Bark is smooth and gray.
* **Fruit:** Globose capsule containing 3 bean-like seeds. Seeds are poisonous raw and not used as food.
* **Wood strength/durability:** Wood (called *Parica*) is pale, medium-density, moderately hard (Janka \~960 lbf)【30†L37-40】. Sapwood is inedible and heartwood is perishable with **poor decay resistance**.
* **Size:** 20–30 m tall, trunk 0.5–1 m dia【30†L31-37】.
* **Uses:** Secondary timber after rubber yields. Used for veneer, plywood, furniture, flooring, cabinets, interior trim and carving【30†L89-90】. (Latex, not wood, is the tree’s primary product.)

### 5. Strangler Fig (*Ficus* spp.)

* **Unique:** Many *Ficus* species are hemi-epiphytic; seeds germinate high, send roots down and can envelop host trees, often forming massive buttressed structures. Produces a sticky white latex.
* **Fruit:** The “fig” is an enclosed inflorescence (syconium) containing many flowers/seeds. Birds and mammals eat the sweet fig fruit; some species’ fruit are eaten by people in traditional cultures.
* **Wood:** Fig wood is generally light-colored, soft to moderately hard. Density is low (\~510 kg/m³) and durability is poor. It is easily worked but not very strong.
* **Size:** Varies by species; many are 10–30 m with broad crowns. Banyan fig (see *Ficus benghalensis*) can cover large areas via aerial roots.
* **Uses:** Limited timber value. Historically used for cheap boards, boxes or carving small objects. More important as a fruit crop (figs) and shade tree than for wood.

### 6. Teak (*Tectona grandis*)

* **Unique:** Tall deciduous Asian tree with large oblong leaves and terminal panicles of small white flowers. Leaves turn yellow in dry season. Straight thick bole.
